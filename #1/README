## Virtual DAC

Create a Virtual DAC using any programming language.

In electronics, a digital-to-analog converter (DAC, D/A, or D-to-A) is a system that converts a digital signal into an analog signal. The term DAC is also used to refer to a complete system that includes both the digital-to-analog converter and the analog filter required to produce the desired output waveform. An 8 bit converter can represent 2^8 different values, with each sucessive value differing by 1/256 of the full scale value. A 10 bit converter can represent 2^10 different values, with each successive value differing by 1/1024 of the full scale value. A 16 bit converter can represent 2^16 different values, with each successive value differing by 1/65536 of the full scale value.

## Objective

Create a function that takes a decimal number as an argument and returns a number that represents the analog value of the input.

The value range is 0-1023, reference range is 0-5.00 volts. Value and reference is directly proportional.

This DAC has 10 bits of resolution and the DAC reference is 5.00 volts.

## Example
    
    ```js 
    dac(0) // 0
    dac(1023) // 5.00
    dac(512) // 2.50
    dac(256) // 1.25

### Notes
You should retrun a number rounded to two decimal places.
